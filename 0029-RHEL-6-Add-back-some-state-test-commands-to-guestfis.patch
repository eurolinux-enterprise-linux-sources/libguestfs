Subject: [PATCH 29/31] RHEL 6: Add back some state test commands to guestfish (RHBZ#971664).

In RHEL 6, re-add the following commands to ensure there is no
regression between RHEL 6.4 and RHEL 6.5:

  get-state            get the current state
  is-busy              is busy processing a command
  is-launching         is launching subprocess
  is-ready             is ready to accept commands

(As a side-effect this also adds 'wait-ready' which is a no-op).

These commands have been removed upstream and will be removed
permanently in RHEL 7.  The reason is that these commands do not do
anything useful.
